## Energy Levels after drinking energy drinks (Sugar-Free vs Sugar â€“ Brand vs Brand)

In this study, I decided to analyse and compare energy drink brands and their sugar-free options. The goal of the study was to see if there was a connection between brands/sugar-free energy drinks and the impact that it had on my energy levels after drinking them. Considering I regularly drink energy drinks of all kinds for multiple purposes (tiredness, routine and sports), I also decided to include those reasons within my dataset to provide surrounding context and see if there was an effect there as well. To make my data more robust, I also included whether or not I had symptoms after drinking in my logging form.

The bar charts show my energy levels on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being too high and 1 being too low that I didn't feel any change. The colours of the charts represent the proportion of those scores were from which energy drink brand or were a sugar/sugar-free option.

here is the bar chart recording the proportion of my energy scores with blue being sugar-free and red being sugared energy drinks.

the mean number of energy drinks I had that were sugar-free was `r num_yes` ! Whereas the number of sugared energy drinks I had was `r num_no`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = logged_data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = energy_scale, fill = sugar_free))
```

Here is my bar chart for my energy scores across energy drink brands.

```{r}
ggplot(data = logged_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = energy_scale, fill = drink_brand))
```

My favourite energy drink brand was `r most_common$drink_brand[1]` where I had `r most_common$n[1]` this is tied with V.
