# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Psychology
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to be able to use these tools to investigate mental health.
- I am interested in learning about tools and techniques to further investigate research/data in improving mental health
