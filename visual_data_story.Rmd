## Tracking my buzz

Like many students juggling late-night study sessions and early morning starts, energy drinks have become part of my daily routine. Whether it's cracking open a can before a workout or relying on one to stay focused in lectures, I found myself wondering -- *are these drinks actually doing the job?*

Over the past few weeks I decided to put my habits to the test, tracking every drink I consumed, recording variables like brand, can size, reason for drinking, sugar-free status and how I felt afterwards - rating my *energy levels on a scale from 1 to 10*, and noting any symptoms like jutters, crashes or anxiety. 

To uncover the underlying trends of what I call *The Buzz*, I went beyond the raw data and through data wrangling I created new metrics: 
- A symptom score, ranking the severity of any side effects
- A drink effectiveness score (energy level - symptom score)
- And time-based variables to explore how timing influences *The Buzz* (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

This story is going to be structured differently. I'll present

**Now for the story**

## The Morning Kick

I’ve woken up, gotten ready for the day, and made it to the train station. Yet, I'm shivering and dozing off as though I’m wrapped in a blanket next to a heater. I need a solid kick to start my day before heading to classes. I decide on a Musashi, hoping it’ll keep me energized throughout back-to-back lectures. But some mornings, I’m still dozing off a couple of hours later. *What does the data say about this?*

The data shows that my energy in the mornin following an energy drink is pretty consistent. Whereas the afternoon seems to be where my energy levels slow down. However I'm stilling calling into question My drink of choice: A Musash.

## Pre-Workout Dilemma (Afternoon)
After powering through a four-hour block of lectures, I usually grab an energy drink — partly to celebrate, but mostly to gear up for a workout at Hiwa! On days I don’t make it to Hiwa, I opt for a recreational drink instead. Different drinks serve different purposes. But that raises a question: are some drinks actually more effective for their intended context — especially if I want to avoid unwanted symptoms?

![This plot categorizes drinks into two types: sports drinks and recreational drinks. It displays their effectiveness ratings as percentages based on different usage contexts. Effectiveness is divided into three levels: highly effective, moderately effective, and ineffective.](https://i.postimg.cc/rp4Vbbg1/my-plot1.png)

Notably, recreational drinks are effective 60% of the time when used to combat tiredness, while sports drinks show a 50/50 split in effectiveness when used for gym sessions.

So, I should expect some variability when using sports drinks before a workout — they aren't guaranteed to be effective every time. Recreational drinks, on the other hand, tend to be moderately effective, especially when I'm just trying to fight off tiredness. In short, different drinks offer different benefits, but neither is a *silver bullet*. 

I'm tempted to 'reward' myself with another drink. **Big mistake**

## Evening Routine: Study Crash
Now that the fun's over, I have to start studying again. The workout's left me a little parched and I need some energy to continue studying properly before I go to bed. I took a V, which seems harmless, but our plot seems to say otherwise. 

Monster comes out on top — it delivers the most energy with the fewest symptoms, making it a solid choice., drinks like Red Bull, V, and Powerade seem a bit riskier in terms of side effects.

![This plot shows how different drink brands compare in terms of average energy and symptom scores. Since symptom scores range from 0 to 3 (with 3 being the worst)](https://i.postimg.cc/cJ0Hg3Yq/my-plot2.png)

Pairing this with the information from the previous two plots tells me I'm going to be feeling the brunt of *The Buzz* tonight.
